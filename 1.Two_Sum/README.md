# 1. Two Sum

## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in **any order**.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
```

### Explanation

```text
nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
```

---

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

---

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

---

## Constraints

```text
2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
```

---

## Notes

- Exactly **one valid answer** exists.
- You may not use the **same element twice**.

---

## Follow-up

- Can you come up with an algorithm that is **better than O(n²)** time complexity?
